    <h2 id="title">1. Selection of microalgae species </h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 75px;" >
        What makes a species suitable? <br> </p>
    <p id="pg">
    1. Lipid Content: Species with high lipid percentages are ideal for biodiesel. For instance, Nannochloropsis can have up to 60% lipid content by dry weight. <br>
    2. Growth Rate: Faster-growing species produce more biomass in less time. Chlorella vulgaris is popular because it doubles its biomass every day under optimal conditions. <br>
    3. Adaptability: Species that thrive in specific environments (e.g., salty water, high CO₂) reduce resource use. <br>
    4. Byproducts: Some species have additional benefits, like proteins for animal feed or pigments for dyes. <br>
    </p>

    <h2 id="title">2.Cultivation </h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 75px;" >
        How do algae grow? <br> </p>
    <p id="pg">
        They use photosynthesis to convert sunlight, water, and CO₂ into biomass. <br>
        Nutrients like nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and trace metals are added to the growth medium. <br>
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 75px;" >
        Types of Systems:<br> </p>
    <p id="pg">
        Open Ponds: Large shallow pools, exposed to the environment.<br>
        Advantages: Cheap and simple. <br>
        Challenges: Contamination by other microorganisms, water loss due to evaporation. <br>
        Photobioreactors (PBRs): Enclosed, controlled systems with transparent tubes or tanks. <br>
        Advantages: Higher productivity, no contamination. <br>
        Challenges: High initial setup and maintenance costs. <br>
        Hybrid Systems: Combine open ponds for initial growth and PBRs for boosting production. <br>
    </p>



    <h2 id="title">3. Harvesting</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 75px;" >
        Why is it challenging? <br> </p>
    <p id="pg">
        Microalgae are tiny (3-30 micrometers) and suspended in large amounts of water. Separating them efficiently without using too much energy is tricky.<br>
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 75px;" >
        Methods <br> </p>
    <p id="pg">
        1. Centrifugation: Spins water and algae at high speed. Heavier algae separate to the bottom. <br>
        2. Flocculation: Chemicals or natural bioflocculants (e.g., chitosan) cause algae cells to stick together, forming clumps that are easier to filter. <br>
        3. Filtration: Mesh screens trap algae while water passes through. <br>
        4. Sedimentation: Allowing algae to settle naturally under gravity. Works best with flocculation. <br>

    </p>

    <h2 id="title">4. Drying </h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 75px;" >
        Techniques<br> </p>
    <p id="pg">
       1.  Spray Drying: Fine droplets of algae are sprayed into hot air. Quick but uses a lot of energy. <br>
       2.  Freeze Drying: Water is frozen and then removed by sublimation (turning solid ice directly into vapor). Preserves quality but is expensive. <br>
       3.  Sun Drying: Cheap and eco-friendly but slow and weather-dependent.<br>
    </p>

    <h2 id="title">5. Lipid Extraction</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 75px;" >
        Extraction methods: <br> </p>
    <p id="pg">
       1. Mechanical Extraction: Crushing algae using presses or bead mills to release oils. <br>
       2. Chemical Extraction: Solvents like hexane dissolve lipids, which are then separated. <br>
       3. Supercritical CO₂ Extraction: CO₂ under high pressure acts as a solvent to extract oils. This is eco-friendly and leaves no toxic residues but requires expensive equipment. <br>
         
    </p>

    <h2 id="title">6. Biofuel Conversion</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 75px;" >
        Conversion Techniques<br> </p>
    <p id="pg">
        Biodiesel (Transesterification): Lipids react with alcohol (methanol or ethanol) and a catalyst (e.g., sodium hydroxide) to produce biodiesel and glycerol. <br>
        Bioethanol (Fermentation): Carbohydrates are broken into sugars by enzymes and fermented by yeast to produce ethanol. <br>
        Biogas (Anaerobic Digestion): Residual biomass decomposes in the absence of oxygen to produce methane. <br>
    </p>

    <h2 id="title">7. Refinement </h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 75px;" >
       How? <br> </p>
    <p id="pg">
        Biodiesel: Washed to remove leftover chemicals or impurities. <br>
        Bioethanol: Distilled to separate ethanol from water and other byproducts. <br>
        Biogas: Upgraded by removing unwanted gases (like CO₂) to increase methane concentration. <br>
